        "description": "This is a replacement for the original frame sticker, we make it more high quality by using outdoor colored in the mass vinyl instead of the printed one, we also give the option of a paint protection film on top. We are not affiliated with Brompton in any way, we started making this because i wanted a better sticker when i restored my Brompton, and after restoring my bike most of my friends wanted something similar. We also give you the option to get any color you want as long as you can provide us a RAL color code.  If you want something custom logo or text that is also a option."
